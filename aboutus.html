	<h1> The Sugary Dessert Known as Cake </h1>

	<p><h2> What is cake? </h2></p>

	<p> Cake is a type of dessert made of a flavorable and sugarfilled batter, layered with frosting, and decorated in assorted fondants, colored frostings, and sprinkles.</p>

	<p><h2> Flavors and Layers </h2></p>

	<p> Cake comes in many flavors, original and unique. Cake is always good, whether it's simple or complex. In my opinion, the richest flavor is chocolate layered with chocolate frosting. Not only is it delicious, but the dark chocolate flavor comes through more than any other flavor of cake. Layers are used to give the eater more texture and sometimes more flavor in every bite. Some advanced bakers add in textures, fruits, or anything that would enhance the cakes flavor.</p>

 <p><h2> Popularity and Changes </h2></p>
 <p> Because of cake's popularity, another dessert was created to give people the same experience, but in a smaller serving. This dessert is the cupcake. For people who think that cake is to dry in its large quantity and the amount of time it spends in the oven, the cupcake answers their prayers. With less baking time but the same delicious flavors, the cupcake is very popular especially as a birthday party treat. </p>

 <p><h2> Creativity and Art </h2></p>
 <p> Of all desserts, cakes have the most room for creativity and design. Wedding cakes for example are very intricate and delicate looking on the outside. Cakes have the largest surface for decorations, as if the top of the cake is a canvas for art. Fondant and modeling chocolate is often used with edible glitter and assorted frostings to transform the cakes into little intricate pieces of art. </p>
