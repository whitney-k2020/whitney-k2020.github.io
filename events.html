<h1> Our Events </h1>

<p><h2> <a href="index.html"> Home</a> | Events </h2></p>

<p><h2> Normally, we'd plan a monthly event at our in-person location, which you can read about <a href="locations.html">here</a>, but in these health situations, we have altered them a little bit. Fun and creativity can't be suppressed by a quarantine, it's a bad attitude that does that. Baking can try to bring that back, so these are especially important now! </h2></p>

<p> These are this month's events:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle"> 
	<li><b> Funfetti Instagram Tag</b>: Bake something, anything you'd like, but you have to make it sprinkled with color or sprinkles! It can also be tie dyed if that is preffered in your creative eyes! Post a photogenic and aesthetic picture on Instagram and tag us! We will award the most colorful and creative one! </li>
	<li><b> Family Baking Night</b>: Make a homemade baked good with your loved ones! This won't be live over zoom, but if you post about your time together and the amazing creation you all make, tag us and we will put your picture on our website! </li>
	<li><b> Kids Class</b>: Over zoom, we will teach kids how to make a few recipies! From funfetti cupcakes to loaded brownies, we will make your little ones smile with pride and happiness over their new found passion for creating!</li> 
</ul></p>
