<p><h2> Get to know Whit's Kakes! </h2></p>

<p> Welcome to Whit's Kakes! Personally, as the creator of this online bakery, I think our goal is very important, especially in times like a pandemic lockdown. A little sugar always brightens your day a little more, and as much as we'd appreciate your business, baking is also calming and theraputic. </p>

<p><h2> Our Goal </h2></p>

<p> Even though we are just a bakery, our goal is to spread happiness in every bite of our desserts. There is too much negativity in the world, and even though sugar isn't the cure, it's a small step. We wanted to take classic desserts you love and add splashes of flavor and creatvity. We don't want to be like every other business, we want to be unique in our treats and we hope to bring a smile to your face! </p>

<p><h2> Inspiration </h2></p>

<p> Like I said before, there is so much negativity in the world. There are some things that are just out of our control, but our attitude towards these things can always change! Smiles and possitivity go a long way! Hopefully our sweet treats can bring some! If not, we also have a few inspirational words that we hope you carry with you with your desserts:

	<ul style="list-style-type: circle ">
		<li> "Desserts are the fairy tales of the kitchen- a-happily-ever-after to supper" -Terri Guillemets</li>
		<li> "Stressed is desserts spelled backwards." -unknown</li>
		<li> "If we are what we eat... Well, I am awfully sweet" -unknown </li>
		<li> "Life is short and unpredictable. Eat the dessert first!" -Helen Keller </li>
	</ul></p>
