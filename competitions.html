	<p><h2> <a href="index.html"> Home</a> | Competitions </h2></p>

	<p><h2> In order to raise awareness of our business and to encourage people to take an entrepaneaur path in the future, we have comps where YOU can participate and fuel your creativity! Part of the fun of baking is building an idea, learning from mistakes, and coming out with a product you are proud of calling your own, which is exactly what we want you to experience! </h2></p>

	<p> These competitions fluctuate in details, but they are monthly! We hope you find one that intrigues you! Look through this months options:
		<ul style="list-style-type: circle"> 
			<li> <b>Create Menu Item</b>: The guidelines for this comp are not super strict, which leaves lots of room for creativity and we will be looking for uniqueness. What you need to do is dream up a dessert of any category that represents you in some way. Think of flavor combinations, design, and quality that represents you inside and out. This could be a model of your personality, interests, heritage, anything that shows you! Have fun! </li>
			<li> <b>Cupcake Wars</b>: This is a fun one if you are a more advanced baker and creator. You will be working with flavors you might not initially think of as the heart of a cupcake. Modeled after the TV show, you will be given 5 ingrediants and must pick 3 to use. You have to make 2 different cupcakes out of those 3 ingrediants, but you have the entire month, so think creativly and innovatively! </li>
		</ul></p>
