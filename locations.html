<p><h2> This business is primarily an online bakery, but our one store is in beautiful San Francisco, California. We have a gorgeous view of the bay and the Golden Gate bridge! Maybe one day, if we choose to grow our business, we may expand and have stores in other cities, but for the moment, SF is the only one. Due to the health crisis occuring at the moment, we are not opening our doors, but we are delivering our baked goods! We don't need to be together in person, and right now we are highly encouraging staying home! We are together in spirit and we are all hoping for a brighter future ahead! </h2></p>
